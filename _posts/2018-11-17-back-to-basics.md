Ah, welcome back traveler. We have changed things around here, and currently in the progress of finishing up the initial (re-)re-renovations. Would you like a brief overview?

We are switching our hosting provider to GitHub Pages for the time being as we secure a provider for our other business entity.

Things have been busy!

"Ghost is professional publishing platform designed for modern journalism. This is a demo site of a basic Ghost install to give you a general sense of what a new Ghost site looks like when set up for the first time.

> If you'd like to set up a site like this for yourself, head over to [Ghost.org](https://ghost.org/) and start a free 14 day trial to give Ghost a try!

If you're a developer: Ghost is a completely open source (MIT) Node.js application built on a JSON API with an Ember.js admin client. It works with MySQL and SQLite, and is publicly available [on Github](https://github.com/TryGhost/ghost).

If you need help with using Ghost, you'll find a ton of useful articles on [our knowledgebase](https://help.ghost.org/), as well as extensive [developer documentation](https://docs.ghost.org/)."
