Hello, friend!

Things have been chaotic. The pandemic has had a profound effect on how people around the world live their lives day-to-day. In addition to the terrifying number of lives lost, the political and economic implications of COVID-19, and relevant events, continue to ripple through the world. The year 2020 has been a difficult year for everyone.

As a responsible Canadian entrepreneur, I am currently working on developing an outreach and sales strategy that will help great local businesses receive professional digital marketing services at affordable rates or prices, foregoing short term revenue for long-term business relationships.

Unfortunately, the daily implications of the recommendations and guidelines defined by the World Health Organization has forced ALL businesses to maintain some form of digital presence.

Most of my time in the foreseeable future will no doubt be dedicated to working towards providing digital marketing solutions and technology consultation to help Canadian businesses achieve a new benchmark in their digital marketing presence.

As Canadian businesses adopt more integrated digital solutions for their business, Canadian products and services become more globally available for convenient purchase due to the intrinsic advantages of buying Canadian.

Thank you for reading, and don't forget to praise that sun!
