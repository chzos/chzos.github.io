Hurrah! Finally a re-design of my site that is a baseline

I have updated my website to reflect a baseline of the aesthetic philosophy and design strategy of future projects.

The development of this website started befor

Installing MathJax on this blog.

Launch of two websites, this personal blog project and a more professional business website that are both being worked on at a more rapid pace.

Also working on my first digital product and writing.

Most of my time is being spent on project and product development and financial investment.

A lot of content has been lost in the numerous re-design attempts as I optimize my workflow, project development process, and maintaining some semblance of a work-life balance as an entrepreneur.

In the future I hope to have more time to dedicate to writing, and of course incorporating Grammarly for personal, academic, and professional writing.
